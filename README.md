## Introduction

The `printf` function in the C programming language is used to print formatted output to the standard output (usually the console). It is a versatile and essential function, and this project aims to implement a simplified version of it with some of the basic functionalities.

## Features

- Supports various format specifiers for different data types.
- Handles basic flag options for formatting.
- Customizable width and precision for formatting.
- Handles special characters and escape sequences.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/printf-project.git
   ```

2. Include the `main.h` header file in your C program.
   ```c
   #include "main.h"
   ```

3. Compile your program with the `printf` function implementation.
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o my_program
   ```

4. Run your compiled program.
   ```bash
   ./my_program
   ```

## Supported Format Specifiers

- `%c` - Character
- `%s` - String
- `%d` - Integer (decimal)
- `%i` - Integer (decimal)
- `%u` - Unsigned Integer
- `%o` - Octal
- `%x` - Hexadecimal (lowercase)
- `%X` - Hexadecimal (uppercase)
- `%p` - Pointer Address
- `%%` - Percent Sign

## Examples

1. Printing a character:
   ```c
   _printf("The first letter of the alphabet is %c\n", 'A');
   ```

2. Printing a string:
   ```c
   _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "ALX");
   ```

3. Printing an integer:
   ```c
   _printf("The answer to the question is %d\n", 42);
   ```
